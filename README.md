# CanadasPopulation

Project coded in C# 

One of the current trends in modern software applications is to query different data sources with various data formats such as JSON, XML, and CSV. 
These formats are widely used in several business domains, including distributed systems and data analytics, to foster data retrieval and analysis.

In this project, different data formats (JSON, XML, and CSV ) were worked with directly in C#. 

The data used in this project was extracted from the World Cities Database (https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities).

Data is extracted and modeled into a Windows Form, allowing users to select different cities/provinces from Canada and display different statistics around them.
